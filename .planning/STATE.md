# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** A speaker shares one URL; a conference organizer finds everything they need — profile, assets, talks, past conferences — without the speaker maintaining a separate doc or PDF.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Build Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Build Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 1 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Roadmap revised; Composer/PSR-4 removed; WordPress-standard require_once approach adopted; ready to begin Phase 1 planning

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Leaflet.js for world map (GPL-compatible, no API key required)
- [Roadmap]: `@wordpress/scripts` replaces entire node-sass/gulp/csso-cli pipeline
- [Roadmap]: No Composer, no PSR-4 namespacing — existing `inc/` structure and `Speekr` class preserved; new PHP files added to `inc/` and loaded via `require_once` in `inc/classes/Speekr.php`
- [Roadmap]: Block registration handled by `speekr_register_blocks()` plain function in `inc/blocks/blocks.php`, not a namespaced class
- [Roadmap]: Geocoding strategy for Conference lat/lng is an open design decision — must be resolved before Phase 4 (manual entry vs. geocoding API vs. coordinate lookup table)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Geocoding strategy for Conference lat/lng must be decided before `blocks/conference-map/` implementation begins. Options: (a) manual lat/lng entry fields, (b) geocoding API call at post save, (c) bundled country/city coordinate lookup table. No external API key dependency preferred.
- [Phase 5]: Verify that Talks and Conferences CPT slugs use hyphens (not underscores) before FSE template registration — WP template name validation rejects underscores. Check `speekr_get_cpt_slug()` in `inc/functions/helpers.php`.
