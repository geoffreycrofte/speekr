# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** A speaker shares one URL; a conference organizer finds everything they need — profile, assets, talks, past conferences — without the speaker maintaining a separate doc or PDF.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Build Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Build Foundation)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (Plan 04 complete — browser verified, legacy assets cleaned up)
Status: Phase 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Plan 04 complete: watch mode verified, browser approved (no 404s, fonts render), legacy CSS/SCSS/JS removed from assets/

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~2 min
- Total execution time: ~7 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-build-foundation | 4 | ~12 min | ~3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~1 min), 01-02 (~1 min), 01-03 (~5 min), 01-04 (~5 min)
- Trend: consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Leaflet.js for world map (GPL-compatible, no API key required)
- [Roadmap]: `@wordpress/scripts` replaces entire node-sass/gulp/csso-cli pipeline
- [Roadmap]: No Composer, no PSR-4 namespacing — existing `inc/` structure and `Speekr` class preserved; new PHP files added to `inc/` and loaded via `require_once` in `inc/classes/Speekr.php`
- [Roadmap]: Block registration handled by `speekr_register_blocks()` plain function in `inc/blocks/blocks.php`, not a namespaced class
- [Roadmap]: Geocoding strategy for Conference lat/lng is an open design decision — must be resolved before Phase 4 (manual entry vs. geocoding API vs. coordinate lookup table)
- [Phase 01-build-foundation]: defaultConfig.entry() must be called as a function in @wordpress/scripts v27+; webpack.config.js documents this with inline comment
- [Phase 01-build-foundation]: build/ is NOT gitignored (WordPress plugin convention); only build/**/*.map is excluded
- [Phase 01-build-foundation Plan 02]: @font-face url() paths in src/frontend/style.scss use ../../assets/fonts/front/ (relative to build/frontend/ output, not source location)
- [Phase 01-build-foundation Plan 03]: @wordpress/scripts CSS output uses style- prefix — entry admin/index produces build/admin/style-index.css (not index.css); entry frontend/style produces build/frontend/style-style.css (not style.css)
- [Phase 01-build-foundation Plan 03]: RTL companion files auto-emitted: style-index-rtl.css, style-style-rtl.css
- [Phase 01-build-foundation Plan 04]: Legacy cleanup gated on human-verify — files deleted only after browser confirmation of no 404s and font rendering
- [Phase 01-build-foundation Plan 04]: assets/js/speekr-admin.js retained alongside src/admin/index.js — both are same source; deferred cleanup

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Geocoding strategy for Conference lat/lng must be decided before `blocks/conference-map/` implementation begins. Options: (a) manual lat/lng entry fields, (b) geocoding API call at post save, (c) bundled country/city coordinate lookup table. No external API key dependency preferred.
- [Phase 5]: Verify that Talks and Conferences CPT slugs use hyphens (not underscores) before FSE template registration — WP template name validation rejects underscores. Check `speekr_get_cpt_slug()` in `inc/functions/helpers.php`.
